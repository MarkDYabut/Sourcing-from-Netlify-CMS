title: There's a reason for everything
---
The good is self-explanatory.

The bad teaches us what not to do, enhancing what we do.

Take a moment to reconnect and remember our power

* be thankful for the good, but also for the bad; the bad allows us to grow, the good is the reward for our growth
* all it takes is 5 seconds to realize, we are guided; there is a path for us, but it requires a sense of faith 
* this journey we are on is unique to ourselves and our power is our belief; what matters more than what we say, is our belief in what we say
