title: Fuck the comfort zone
---
"There’s no growth in the comfort zone and no comfort in the growth zone."

“It’s hard to wake up at 5am to go run, when you’re sleeping in silk pajamas”.

"The key to happiness, you see, is not in seeking more of it - but in being content with less of it." -Socrates

"I've never arrived, and every time i get close to ___ → I fall back down on purpose. Because true growth is from scratch"

"There has to be friction in life to move forward, like sharpening a sword"
