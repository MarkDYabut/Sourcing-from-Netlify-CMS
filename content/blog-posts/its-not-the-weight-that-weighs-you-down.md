title: It's not the weight that weighs you down
---
It's how you carry it.

We all have a weight on our back.

We all have our privileges, but you don't ever know what's going on psychologically.

Normalize, because it's all part of the human experience.  

Embrace vulnerability it allows for the most growth.

It's unfortunate that we don't know what going on in others.

Our vulnerability is our signal; just like a baby's cry.

If we do not expose our vulnerabilities we cannot grow past them.

Hiding from emotions, pretending to be strong; is not strength.

We gain strength by exposing our vulnerabilities and overcoming them.
