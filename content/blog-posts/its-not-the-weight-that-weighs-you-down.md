title: It's not the weight that weighs you down
---
It's how you carry it.

* we all have a weight on our back
* we all have our privileges, but you don't ever know what's going on psychologically
* normalize, because it's all part of the human experience
* embrace vulnerability

  * it allows for the most growth
* it's unfortunate that we don't know what going on in others
* our vulnerability is our signal; just like a baby's cry
* if we do not expose our vulnerabilities we cannot grow past them
* hiding from emotions, pretending to be strong; is not strength
* we gain strength by exposing our vulnerabilities and overcoming them
