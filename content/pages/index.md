To unshackle your mind. Ditch the victim's mentality forever. Own all aspects of your life completely. Build an unbreakable foundation.

The value in somethings may not lie in what one gains from it, but at what one pays for it, what it costs us.
It may be a noble and worthy goal, but at what price?
Keep in mind, the truth is very expensive.
